how do we handle responses with over 2k chars, cant split it into several messages can we?
running inhibitors on slash commands?
storing slash commands in command_usage, maybe distinguish them



Commands are run in 3 ways:
commandHandler (normal commands)
runCommand fn (For continuing mostly)
slash commands

let users see their own command usage for testing


logging commands/const shard = message.guild ? message.guild.shardID : 0;
		this.client.emit(
			'log',
			[
				`[${shard}]`,
				`${command.name}(${message.args ? message.args.join(', ') : ''})`,
				`${message.author.username}[${message.author.id}]`,
				message.guild ? `${message.guild.name}[${message.guild.id}]` : 'Direct Messages'
			].join(' ')
		);
